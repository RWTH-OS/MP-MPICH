NOTES:

This Project creates the file rcluma.cpl

*.clp files are dynamic librarys for the Control Panel 

With this ControlApplett you can start and stop the cluster manager service.

To show the ControlApplet-Icon in the Control Panel the file rcluma.cpl has to be copied 
to the Windows\ System folder.

If you want to debug this CPL-file you have to specify rundll32.exe as the executable.
neccessary program parameters: shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL rcluma.cpl
