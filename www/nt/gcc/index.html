<p><font size="6">MPICH.NT.1.2.0</font></p>

<p>This release supports tcp/ip and shared memory connections. Interprocess communication
on a single machine is done through shared memory queues and communication between
processes on separate machines is done through sockets. This is not considered an optimal
implementation.&nbsp; It is a correct implementation which passes all but one function in
our test suite and IBM's test suite .</p>

<p>Installation</p>

<p>1) Install the mpich dlls. 

<ul>
  <li>The runtime dlls come in the MPICH Runtime Dlls package or the MPICH SDK package.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) Install a launcher. 

<ul>
  <li>MPICH Launcher: This is the preferred launcher.&nbsp; It requires administrator
    privileges to install.</li>
  <li>MPICH Simple Launcher: This launcher is provided for users who wish to evaluate MPICH
    without requiring any privileges to install.&nbsp; It is limited in its capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Compile an MPI application 

<ul>

</ul>

<p>4) Run an application. 

<ul>
  <li>Each launcher provides an application launcher called MPIRun.exe.&nbsp; Instructions can
    be found on the web pages provided with the launcher.</li>
</ul>
