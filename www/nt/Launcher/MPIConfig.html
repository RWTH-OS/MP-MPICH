<p>In order to run an application on various hosts without specifying the hosts in a
configuration file, the launcher needs to know which hosts it has been installed on.
&nbsp; MPIConfig.exe is a simple program which finds the hosts where the launcher has been
installed and writes this list of hosts to the registry.&nbsp; With this information
MPIRun can pick hosts from the list in the registry when determining where to launch
processes.</p>

<p><strong>Refresh:</strong></p>

<p>Refresh queries the network for the host names.</p>

<p><strong>Find:</strong></p>

<p>Find connects to the registry on each host in the list and determines whether the
launcher has been successfully installed.&nbsp; When it is finished, the selected hosts
are the ones where the launcher is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Verify:</strong></p>

<p>When verify is clicked, mpiconfig connects to each of the selected hosts and confirms
that the DCOM server is reachable.&nbsp; This feature has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p><strong>Set:</strong></p>

<p>When set is clicked, mpiconfig makes a group out of all the selected hosts by writing
this list of host names to the registry on each host.&nbsp; When MPIRun is executed from
any of the hosts in a group with the -np option, hosts will be selected from this list.</p>
