<p>The launcher is a DCOM server which resides on each host which will provide CPU's for
mpich applications.&nbsp; The DCOM server runs as a service under the SYSTEM account.
&nbsp; When MPIRun connects to the launcher, the launcher impersonates the user who
executed MPIRun and launches processes in the context of that user.&nbsp; The launcher
does not map the network drives that the current user has mapped.&nbsp; The launcher does
not load the registry hive of the current user.</p>

<p>With the launcher installed on all the machines in a cluster, you can use MPIRun to
launch an mpich application:</p>

<p>You must install the MPICH runtime dlls before attempting to launch an application with
MPIRun.</p>
