<p>In order to run an application on various hosts without specifying the hosts in a
configuration file, the launcher needs to know which hosts it has been installed on.
&nbsp; MPIConfig.exe is a simple program which finds the hosts where the launcher has been
installed and writes this list of hosts to the registry.&nbsp; With this information
MPIRun can pick hosts from the list in the registry when determining where to launch
processes.</p>

<p><strong>Refresh:</strong></p>

<p>Refresh queries the network for the host names.</p>

<p><strong>Find:</strong></p>

<p>Find connects to the registry on each host in the list and determines whether the
launcher has been successfully installed.&nbsp; When it is finished, the selected hosts
are the ones where the launcher is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Verify:</strong></p>

<p>When verify is clicked, mpiconfig connects to each of the selected hosts and confirms
that the DCOM server is reachable.&nbsp; This feature has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p><strong>Set:</strong></p>

<p>When set is clicked the following dialog pops up:</p>

<p>If you select &quot;set HOSTS&quot; mpiconfig makes a group out of all the selected hosts
and writes
this list of host names to the registry on each host.&nbsp; When MPIRun is executed from
any of the hosts in a group with the -np option, hosts will be selected from this list.</p>

<p>If you select &quot;set TEMP&quot; mpiconfig will write this directory to the
registry on each host.&nbsp; The remote shell server needs to make a temporary
file for communication with the first launched process and the file needs to be
in a location that is read/write-able by both the remote shell service and the
user launching the mpich application.&nbsp; The remote shell server uses this
entry to determine where to write this file.&nbsp; The default is C:\</p>
