<p>The remote shell server is a DCOM server which resides on each host that provides CPU's for
mpich applications.&nbsp; The DCOM server runs as a service under the SYSTEM account.
&nbsp; When MPIRun connects to the remote shell server, the server impersonates the user who
executed MPIRun and launches processes in the context of that user.&nbsp; The
server does not map the network drives that the current user has mapped.&nbsp; The
server does
not load the registry hive of the current user.</p>

<p>With the server installed on all the machines in a cluster, you can use MPIRun to
launch an mpich application:</p>

<p>You must install the MPICH runtime dlls before attempting to launch an application with
MPIRun.</p>

<p>MPIRun has an option, -np, which runs an application on the first n available machines.
&nbsp; To set up the -np option for MPIRun, run MPIConfig:</p>
