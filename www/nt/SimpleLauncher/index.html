<p>This is a simple socket based launcher used to start mpich applications.&nbsp; It is
not secure and it does not impersonate the client user when launching processes.&nbsp; It
does not require special privileges to be installed.&nbsp; The reason this launcher is
provided is so that users who want to evaluate the software can install an run mpich
applications easily, without requiring administrator privileges to install.</p>

<p>There are two parts to the launcher:

<ol>
  <li><a href="mpichsh.html">MPICHSH.exe</a></li>
  <li><a href="mpirun.html">MPIRun.exe</a></li>
</ol>

<p>MPICHSH.exe is the server which resides on each host in the cluster.</p>

<p>MPIRun.exe is the application launcher which connects to the servers and launches the
mpich application.</p>

<p>Note: The MPICH runtime dlls must be installed on each node before an MPICH application
can be launched.</p>
