<p>Usage: 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier">MPICHSH&nbsp;[port]</font></li>
</ul>

<p>MPICHSH.exe is a simple process launcher.&nbsp; It starts up and listens on a&nbsp;port
for socket connections.&nbsp; If you don't provide a port number the default is
2020.&nbsp; You must start this program manually on all the machines.&nbsp; It is not a
service; it does not start automatically, it does not require any privileges and it does
not impersonate the client user.&nbsp; It simply waits for connections and launches the
command line that comes over the socket.</p>

<p>The data that comes over a connection is in the following format:</p>

<table border="1" cellPadding="1" cellSpacing="1" width="75%"
style="HEIGHT: 27px; WIDTH: 472px">
  <tr>
    <td noWrap>int length</td>
    <td noWrap><font face="Courier">[-dir&quot;somepath\sub\dir&quot;][-env&quot;var1=val1|var2=val2...&quot;]command
    line arg1 ...</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The length field specifies the number of bytes to follow.&nbsp; The bracketted sections
are optional (actual brackets are not transmitted over the socket).&nbsp; The
-dir&quot;...&quot; section defines in what directory to&nbsp;launch the executable.&nbsp;
The -env&quot;...&quot; section defines environment variables which are set before
launching the process.&nbsp; An example might be:</p>

<table border="1" cellPadding="1" cellSpacing="1" width="75%"
style="HEIGHT: 21px; WIDTH: 1020px">
  <tr>
    <td>122</td>
    <td noWrap><font face="Courier">-dir&quot;c:\temp&quot;-env&quot;MPICH_JOBID=fry.1|MPICH_NPROC=2|MPICH_IPROC=1|MPICH_ROOTHOST=fry|MPICH_ROOTPORT=1234&quot;netpipe.exe
    -reps 3</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Standard out and error from the launched process are redirected back through the
socket.&nbsp; The socket is closed when the process terminates.&nbsp; If a connection is
dropped before the process finishes, the process is killed.</p>

<p>Each connection appears in the dialog list box.&nbsp; The time and command line are
printed out when a process is launched and when it terminates.&nbsp; The number in
brackets matches the start and finish lines and shows how many processes have been
launched.&nbsp; The clear button clears the list window.&nbsp; The OK button closes the
listening socket and exits the program.</p>
