<p><big><big><big>MPIRun.exe</big></big></big></p>

<p>Use MPIRun.exe to launch an mpich application. It is in the [MPICH Simple Launcher
Home]\bin directory. You will probably want to add this directory to your path environment
variable.</p>

<p>Usage: 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier">MPIRun [flags] -port LaunchPortNumber configfile [args ...] </li>
  <li>MPIRun [flags] [-tcp] -localonly #processes&nbsp;executable [args ...] </li>
</ul>

<p>flags<br>
-env &quot;var1=val1|var2=val2|var3=val3...&quot; <br>
-mpichport number (port number for the root process to listen on)</font></p>

<p><big>Configuration files</big>.</p>

<p>The config file format is as follows: </p>

<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <font face="Courier"><pre>[port RootPortNumber]
exe c:\somepath\myapp.exe
 OR \\host\share\somepath\myapp.exe
[args arg1 arg2 arg3 ...]
[env VAR1=VAL1|VAR2=VAL2|...|VARn=VALn]
hosts
hostA #procs
hostB #procs
hostC #procs
...
</pre>
  </font>
</blockquote>

<p>Bracketed lines are optional. The # character will comment out a line</p>

<p>Here is a sample configuration file:</p>

<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <font face="Courier"><pre>port 5500
exe c:\temp\mandel.exe
env MINX=0|MAXX=2|MINY=0|MAXY=2
args -i c:\temp\cool.points
hosts
fry 2
#light 2
jazz 1
</pre>
  </font>
</blockquote>

<p><big>Command line options for MPIRun</big></p>

<p><strong>-localonly #procs</strong></p>

<p>This runs the application on the local machine using the shared memory device.</p>

<p><strong>-localonly #procs -tcp</strong></p>

<p>Add the -tcp switch to force the use of sockets instead of shared memory</p>

<p><strong>-env&nbsp;&quot;var1=val1|var2=val2|var3=val3|...varn=valn&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This will set the environment variables specified in the string before each process is
launched.&nbsp; Remember to quote the string so the command prompt doesn't interpret the
vertical bar as a pipe command.</p>

<p><strong>-mpichport number</strong></p>

<p>For every mpich application, the root process waits on a specific port for the rest of
the processes to connect.&nbsp; In order for two or more mpich applications to run at the
same time from the same root host they must have unique ports to wait on.&nbsp; If you
don't supply a number, the default is 12345.&nbsp; To run more than one application
simultaneously, the user must supply unique port numbers.&nbsp; This number can be
specified in the configuration file on the line: port number</p>

<p><big>How MPIRun launches processes</big></p>

<p>MPIRun makes socket connections to MPICHSH.exe running on each of the hosts specified
in the configuration file (MPICHSH.exe must be manually started on each of the nodes
before MPIRun.exe is called). MPICHSH.exe launches the processes and the output from each
process is redirected over the socket.&nbsp; When the sockets close, the remote processes
have terminated.&nbsp; MPIRun waits for all the sockets to close and then exits.</p>

<p>If you hit &lt;Ctrl C&gt; while MPIRun is running, it will exit - closing all the
sockets.&nbsp; MPICHSH.exe terminates all processes running after the socket connection is
lost.</p>

<p>This launcher is not secure.&nbsp; While the MPICHSH.exe processes are running, anyone
can connect and launch a process.&nbsp; There is a slight bit of obscurity because the
user can specify whatever port they want.&nbsp; The port supplied on the command line to
MPIRun must be the same port that all the MPICHSH.exe processes are waiting on.&nbsp; If
you don't provide a port number to either MPIRun or MPICHSH they default to port 2020 (a
completely arbitrary port chosen after watching 20/20 Wednesday on TV).</p>
