Infos about the Autoconf 2 upgrade
----------------------------------

While updating the autoconf scripts I removed some of the M4 macros which
were "better" replacements for Autoconf standard tests. They can be found in
aclocal.m4 CVS version 1.5 (mp-mpich 1.3.0a and before) and will only be
reinserted if someone has problems compiling mp-mpich without them.

I need to look into this:
   -fortnames? autoconf rules exist...
   -finttype?
