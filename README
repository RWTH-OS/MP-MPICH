MP-MPICH is based on MPICH by ANL:

		      Portable MPI Model Implementation

        		  Version 1.2.0, December 1999

                                 David Ashton
                                 Anthony Chan
				  Bill Gropp
				  Rusty Lusk
                                 Debbie Swider
                                 Rajeev Thakur
			 Argonne National Laboratory

However, it has developed apart from MPICH, featuring an exented device interface and 
other features like MPI-2 one-sided communication. Nevertheless, a vast part of 
MP-MPICH is still MPICH.
