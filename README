This is MP-MPICH, Version 1.5.0, Dec 2007, an MPI-Implementation for Linux, Solaris and 
Windows NT/2000/XP/2003, supporting TCP/IP and the Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) for 
high-performance inter-process communication.

MP-MPICH is based on MPICH by ANL:

		      Portable MPI Model Implementation

        		  Version 1.2.0, December 1999 and some later additions

                         David Ashton
                         Anthony Chan
                          Bill Gropp
                          Rusty Lusk
                         Debbie Swider
                         Rajeev Thakur
                  Argonne National Laboratory

However, it has developed apart from MPICH, featuring an extented device interface and 
other features like:
  - MPI-2 one-sided communication,
  - support for multiple devices compiled into the library, and
  - combining multiple clusters into a big "meta computer".
Nevertheless, a vast part of MP-MPICH is still MPICH.
