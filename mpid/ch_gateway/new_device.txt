~/mpich/mpid $ NewDevice gateway
Building new device gateway
You should modify ch_gateway/Makefile.in to use the correct ch files (for
example, choosing blocking eager (chbeager) over nonblocking eager
(chneager)).  Modify ch_gateway/mpid_time.h to use the correct time routines
for this device.  Modify ch_gateway/chconfig.h and chdef.h for the correct
Channel device definitions.
 
If you are NOT using the channel device, you can delete chdef.h and you
MUST replace mpiddev.h (which is a link to mpid/ch2/mpiddevbase.h).
 
You will probably need a gatewaypriv.c file.
 
You can add your new device to mpirun by creating an mpirun.gateway.in file
in mpich/util .
 
You may find that some routines are missing.  Look for them in mpid/ch2;
it may be that you need to establish links to them.  NewDevice simply
creates a copy of ch_nx; each device has a different set of requirements.
Shared memory versions should consider ch_shmem or ch_lfshmem.
