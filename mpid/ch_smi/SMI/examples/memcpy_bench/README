MemcpyBench for Benchmarking SMI_Memcpy and SMI_Imemcpy

Passed Args:

-t <int>
-n <int>
-s <int>
-i <int>
-e <int>
-c <check_type>
-l
-b 
-a 
-q 
-w 
-r 
-f
-o

-t <int>
This option is used to set the Number of threads to the specified int-Value. At
least one Thread is required. Please note, that each thread requires its own
SCI-memory-space => more sci-space required


-n <int>

This options sets up the number of Retries for the first test-size. It is
decreased debending on the increase-type of the size. 


-s <int>

This options is used to set the size of the first transfer.


-i <int>

This option sets the increasement of the size. By default size is doubled each
time. If -i is specified the increase is addet to size each time. 


-e <int>

This option specifies the size of the last transfer.


-c <check_type>			This option specifies special check-types:

	nocheck			No check at all (default, recommendet for Performance
				maximum tests)

	smi_only		Enable the SMI-Transmission errordetect Feature	. But do
				not verify if mechanism really works

	verify_unchecked	Really verify (by comparing src and dst) if transfer was 
				correct. The SMI-Transmission errordetect Feature is not 
				enabled

	verify_checked		Really verify (by comparing src and dst) if transfer was 
				correct. The SMI-Transmission errordetect Feature is
				enabled. So you can check if it really works.	

	verify_details		like verify_unchecked but print the differenced between
				src an dst on screen

	fail_counters		make a real errorcount and an detect errorcount to
				check the errordetect feature (less or more alarms then
				really needed)

-l	Perform a local benchmark between private and local SCI-memory

-b	Make benchmarks on 2 Nodes in both directions at the same time. If -l is
	Specified All nodes perform local benchmarks...

-a	Test asynchronos Transfer (SMI_Imemcpy). If not specified the default
	SMI_Memcpy will be tested
 
-q	Enqueue DMA-transfer

-w	Write to Remote Node. If -l option is specified, write private to local	
	SCI-memory. This option is default
 
-r	Transfer goes opposite direction than if -w is specified.

-f	Force DMA-transfer, even if transfer-size is to small to be recognized als
	efficient by SMI-Imemcpy. This option only works if -a is specified also

-o	Use the original Order of the machines file (MPI_order)
        SMI will not reorder procoecess. So you can specify which machines to transmit where to 
	exactly 
       
The Benchmark has to be run with an even number of processes. If more then 2
Processes are used, memcpy_bench makes groups of 2 processes benchmarking transfer to each 
other. If you realy want to bring your SCI-network to the limit, try using all
nodes and specify -b option.
