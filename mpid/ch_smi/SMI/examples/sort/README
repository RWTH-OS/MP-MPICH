This directory contains a small example program: the iterative solution 
of a Poisson-Equation on a square grid.
If you try this example on a UNIX-platform with the Argonne MPICH 
version of MPI, the result can be displayed graphically.


********
* UNIX *
********

1. Adjust  all path variables and MPI-related issues according to your
   system installation (considering compiler, libraries (MPI, SMI, 
   compiler, architecture). Also adjust the OS variable to be either
   SOLARIS or LINUX

 
2. Adjust the GRAPHICS variable according to the MPI-version you use. If
   you have installed the MPE-extention of ANL that offers some graphic
   facilities, the variable should be set to

	GRAPHICS = -DGRAPHICS

   otherwise, it should not be defined.

3. Type 'make'

4. Start the program, using the facilities of your MPI-implementation 
   to do so. For the ANL implementation of MPI, MPICH, the files 
   'machines' and 'run_script' will support you in doing so:

   a. Change directory to 'run/SOLARIS' or 'run/LINUX' respectively.

   a. Specify the machine names on that the processes shall execute on 
      in the 'machines' file.

   b. Specify the number of processes that shall be spawned in the 
      'run_script' script and whether one of the processes shall run 
      on the initiating machine ('-nolocal' or not).

   c. Type 'run_script' and enjoy !!!

5. To clean-up processes and Unix shared-segments if you terminate an
   execution with 'Control-C', use the scripts 'mpikill' and
   'remove_shseg' in the 'tools' directory. Before you can use them, 
   you must adapt them such that they will find the right processes/segments.

* WIN32 *
*********

1. Assuming you use the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler/Development Environment,
   this directory contains a suitable project workspace file. Invoke it.

2. Adjust the paths to include files and libraries (e.g. the MPI libraries)

3. Build the executable.

4. Assuming that you use the Argonne MPICH version of MPI for WIN32, the 
   following steps describe the start-procedure:

   a. 

   b.

   c.
