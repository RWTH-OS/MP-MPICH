These tags are "historical" tags from the ch_smi repository. The new tags
for mp-mpich/mpid/ch_smi start below.

tag		description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
release-1	first naive version, close to the original ch_shmem, only
		that it uses SCI shared memory

release-1-nosmi	branch from release one which does not use SMI but uses
		SISCI directly. Incomplete and nonfunctional, since 
		release-2 was developed.

release-2	the shared-memory data structures were completely redesigned
		and optimized for SCI shared memory (lockfree, no remote
		reads). Runs fine, peak bandwith 10 time higher than
		release-1 (15 MB/sec), but needs some optimizing in the area
		of fast remote writes to achieve a higher percentage of the
		maxmium bandwith.

release-2a	introduced FPU memcpy

release-2_91	optimized data structures and protocols for SCI transfer - no
		resemblance with ch_shmem in this area any longer.
		In Version 2.91 is pre-pre alpha of version 3.0, basically
		only the short protocol / control packets work.
		Many bugfixes and code cleanup is needed!

release-2_99	all protocols seem to be working fine now, but possibly some bugs will 
		be found.

release-2_99a   last version for mpich-1.1.1 (the configure/makefiles/mpirun scripts of
		the forthcoming versions will be adjusted for mpich-1.1.2 which has a
		different binary file structure)

release-2_99b   introduced "transporters" to the rendezvous-protocoll to speed up
		transfer of long messages
		This release is for mpich-1.1.2

release-3	This is the release on which the extended abstract SCI-Europe is based.
		All function names have been adopted to MPID_SMI_...(), the filenames
		as well (smi...). A lot of unneeded files have been removed from the 
		repository. 
		Run-Time statistics can be created by compiling witd -DSTATISTICS 
		(see stat.c/stat.h) using a high-precsion/low-latency timer (see getus.h/
		getticks.s)

release-3a	Wow, this is the real one! Bitfield-writes are deadly for SCI-performance,
		removed them everywhere and latency is now <9us (from 25us).
		The run-time-statistics helped a lot in this, further instrumented the
		library.

release-3b	This might be the release version:
		- SCI-Sequence-Checking is done for every message
		  (turn it of by compiling with -DMPID_NOVERIFY)
		- MPI_Wtime does now use GETTICKS() from getus.h, therefor
		  MHz calibrating is done on every start

release-3_1	- fixed a bug in the rendezvous-protocol
		- cleaned up code for compilatoin under NT
		I really think this will be the release version...

release-3_1a	- fixed some installation problems for the distribution
		- this is the first public beta release 1.0 from 01/06/99

fast_rndv	- branch for experiments with a different (faster) rendevous-
		  protocol which uses remote Imalloc()s

release-3_2	- compilable under NT

dynamic		- branch for the dynamic configuration

release-3_2a	- rendez-vous FAAASST now!
		- removed potential deadlock in eager protocol

release-3_3	This is the public release 1.1 from 23/07/99
		- merged in dynamic branch for memory configuration at
		  startup
		- modified startup parameters to be less clumsy
		
release-3_3a	This is the *real* public release 1.1 from 23/07/99
		- corrected alignment for dynamic configuration

release-3_3b	Bugfix release:
		- rendez-vous protocol contained a serious bug for
		  *very* long messages
		- the mpirun.ch_smi script now works better if
		  default config files are used

release-3_3c	Before merging with async-eager2 branch. Uses the new features
		of the SMI library like SMI_Abort() and SMI_Debug()

async		Branch for asynchronous implementation of MPI_ISend() using 
		threads

async-eager	The eager protocoll is now able to do real asynchronous ISends().

async-eager2	Just like async-eager, but also includes the configuration via
		the devconf-file
		This tag was merged with the main branch.

snapshot-3_3c	This is a development snapshot:
		- Isend with threads/memcpy works
		- Isend with DMA does not yet work
		- fix configuration for 64-byte streambuffers
		(before the change for flexible streambuffer sizes)
		- still the old SMI startup parameters

snapshot-3_3d	This is a development snapshot:
		- some more bugfixes, now seems to work fine in all
		  modes on the D310/pci1 SCI boards
		- Problems on D321/psb64:
		  - ready sends (Irsend test)
		  - nblock with 4 or more nodes

snapshot-3_4	This is a development snapshot:
		- no known problems on D310
		- Problems on D321:
		  - ready sends (irsend & irsendinit give error in data)
		All other pt2pt tests work fine for blocking transfer.
		
		- prepared for NONFIXED (use define MPID_SMI_NONFIXED in
		  shdef.h to select)

		NOTE: the snapshot releases between ch_smi and SMI are 
		now synced.

release-3_4a	SCI-MPICH release 1.99

release-3_4b	SCI-MPICH release 1.99a
		- fixed Eager- and Rndv-problems under Linux
		- now passes all pt2pt-Tests except Ready-Sends

release-3_4c	SCI-MPICH release 1.99b
		- fixed statistics

release-3_4d	SCI-MPICH release 1.99c
		- improved the handling of low-memory situations in the 
		  setup of eager and rendez-vous protocoll

snapshot-3_4e	This is a development snapshot:
		- before the introduction of DMA-rendez-vous

snapshot-3_5	This is a development snapshot:
		- SMP via SYSV shared memory is integrated & tested
		- DELAYED segment type will be introduced now
